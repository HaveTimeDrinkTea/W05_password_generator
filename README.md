# w05_password_generator

## Description

This project is part of the Frontend Dev Bootcamp course challenge for the fourth week "JavaScript Fundamentals". 

It requires us to use JavaScript to analyze a dataset containing profit and loss amounts over time. On first glance, the data consists of 2 columns; Period name (Mmm-YYYY) and profit/loss amount (with positive and negative values). 

The analysis should produce a report containing the certain summaries in the browser's console.

The JScript that produces the output into the browser's console is held in assets/scripts/index_computation.js. This should satisfy this challenge's requiremenmts.

In addition to that, I have created another JScript that displays the summaries and data to the index.hml.  The computations have also been verified to be correct in a spreadsheet ([see PDF](assets/images/data.pdf)).
